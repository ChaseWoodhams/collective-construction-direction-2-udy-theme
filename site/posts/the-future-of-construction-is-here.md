Green. Sustainable. LEED. Passive building. Net Zero.

It’s 2020. By now, you’ve heard at least one of these terms that describes an ongoing revolution in the construction community. 

In very simple terms, a Net Zero building is one that generates as much or more energy than it actually uses. The means and methods to construct these buildings are very similar to traditional construction but there are several key design and functional differences which we will detail in a later blog.

Most assume that it’s nothing more than slapping some solar panels on a roof and calling it a day, but that solution is simply not enough to actually become a Net Zero building. 

The basis of Net Zero construction is to design the structure to reduce energy needs by 90 percent. This is done through readily available construction means and supplementing with renewable energy sources when needed.

Most Net Zero projects are based on the overall energy needs annually. So although it may need external sources of power for periods of time, the end of the year net results are a positive balance, meaning the building made more power than it used.

Check back here for future blogs that will discuss the benefits of Net Zero and how

Collective Construction is making it our goal to define these revolutionary construction terms here in Georgia and throughout the Southeast.
