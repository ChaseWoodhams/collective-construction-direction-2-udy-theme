A relatively common perception of eco-friendly or innovative construction is that it’s great other people are doing it, but it’s not something one individual or business themselves would even think about considering.

Thoughts like:

*I’m sure it’s nice but I don’t even want to know how much it costs.*

*I’ve always done it this way so why change now?*

*I don’t live on the West coast; I wouldn’t even know how to obtain that here in Georgia.*

Everyone could have their own reason for converting to this type of construction solution:

* Better indoor air quality for you, your family or co-workers.
* Better thermal comfort and consistency throughout your building.
* Improved sound insulation from whatever is keeping you up at night or distracted during the day.
* Energy efficiency, drastically reducing heating and cooling needs
* Reduced dependency on large electric utilities:
* * Reduced greenhouse gases
  * Reduced losses due to inefficient delivery methods
  * Reduced losses due to large overhead costs

This list is only scratching the surface. As we continue to grow, we will be sharing more about why Net Zero is beneficial and how you can obtain it. 

As always, give us a shout if you want to learn more about building a Net Zero home or commercial building. We are here to be your Net Zero guide in Georgia and throughout the southeast.
