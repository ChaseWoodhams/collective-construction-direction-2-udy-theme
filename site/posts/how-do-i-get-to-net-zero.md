If you are past the point of understanding the benefits of Net Zero energy, you’re now asking yourself how do I even get there? 

As we’ve said before, putting solar panels on a roof simply isn’t enough to free yourself from the big utilities.  Solar panels alone will not get you to Net Zero. Why? Because they only provide energy, they do nothing to decrease how that energy is actually being used. 

Think of it this way, you’ve installed five new solar panels but your insulation and HVAC systems are shot. It’s like sitting in your car on a hot, August day in Georgia with all the windows rolled down and wondering why your A/C isn’t cooling the car down. 

Here’s how to get to a Net Zero building the right way, keeping in mind a range of all budgets:

* Determine the best location on the lot and orientation of the structure for maximum efficiency.
* Design the structure with the best insulating capacity as possible (walls, windows and doors).
* Design the structure to be 100 percent air tight.
* Perform a home energy analysis for peek efficiency.  
* Design the ventilation system to include fresh air supply and energy recovery ventilation.
* Install a waste-minimizing water heater.
* Install energy efficient lighting, appliances and electronics.
* Install solar panels and battery storage to meet energy needs.

Notice how long the list is before we even begin to talk about solar panels or battery storage needs. Frankly, doing it any other way is a waste of your time, money and resources. 

Buying renewable energy from your local utility is not a solid plan to truly become Net Zero, maybe it makes you feel better, and maybe it makes them a lot of money, but it will not help you reach your Net Zero goals.

If you are serious about dropping that huge monthly electric bill and becoming self sufficient, give our team a call. We can help you find the right solution for your situation!
